# BookShelf
Webapp for book recommendation.
Implemented collaborative filtering and K-Means Clustering data mining technique to recommend books based on best ratings and similar users.
Also added a search feature which helps in searching a book from the dataset sorted by the highest ratings.
Moved from university server to GitHub.
Only moved the python scripts, due to the large ammount of dataset.
